# Camma
Camma is a strange windows application that contains borrowed code from other GitHub repositories, it is only usable for pure randomness, homemade stuff, or something else.

It is licensed in a edited version of MIT.

It is licensed' open source.

And it is made by myself.

# How it works

you should execute or compile all of this shit code, and then do it over and over again until you have it, or use a compiler that compiles every file it has, if you are lazy.
